Difference Between a Function and a Method in Python\n"," - Function: A standalone block of code defined using the def keyword. It\n","   operates on data passed as arguments.\n"," - Method: A function associated with an object. It operates on the object  \n","   itself and is called using the dot (.) notation.\n","2. Concept of Function Arguments and Parameters in Python\n"," - Parameters: Variables in a function definition used to accept input values.\n"," - Arguments: Actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n","3. Ways to Define and Call a Function in Python\n"," - Define: Use the def keyword. Optionally use lambda for anonymous functions.\n"," - Call: Type the name of the function and enter the arguments within the   \n","   paranthesis\n","  Example:\n","      def square(x):  # Define\n","        return x ** 2\n","\n","      print(square(5))  # Call\n","4. Purpose of the return Statement in a Python Function\n"," - The return statement sends a value back to the caller and exits the function.\n","   Without return, the function returns None by default\n","5. Iterators vs. Iterables\n"," - Iterable: An object capable of returning one element at a time (e.g., lists, tuples, strings).\n"," - Iterator: An object representing a stream of data from an iterable, created using iter(). It produces elements with next().\n","6. Generators in Python\n"," - Special functions that yield values one at a time using yield instead of return.\n"," - Automatically create an iterator.\n","  Example:\n","  def count_up_to(n):\n","      for i in range(1, n + 1):\n","          yield i\n","\n","  for num in count_up_to(3):\n","      print(num)  # Output: 1, 2, 3\n","7. Advantages of Generators Over Regular Functions\n"," - Memory Efficient: Generate items on demand instead of storing them in memory.\n"," - Infinite Sequences: Suitable for representing streams of data or infinite sequences.\n"," - Simpler Syntax: Easy to implement lazy evaluation.\n","8. Lambda Function in Python\n"," - Anonymous, inline functions defined using the lambda keyword.\n"," - Typically used for short, one-time operations\n","  Example:\n","  square = lambda x: x ** 2\n","  print(square(4))  # Output: 16\n","9. Purpose and Usage of map() Function\n"," - Applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns a map   \n","   object\n","   Example:\n","   nums = [1, 2, 3]\n","  squares = map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums)\n","  print(list(squares))  # Output: [1, 4, 9]\n","10. Difference Between map(), reduce(), and filter()\n"," - map(): Transforms each element of an iterable using a function.\n","  Example:\n","  map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n"," - reduce(): Applies a function cumulatively to items of an iterable (requires  \n","   functools)\n","   Example:\n","   from functools import reduce\n","   reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3])  # Output: 6\n"," - filter(): Filters elements based on a condition.\n","   Example:\n","   filter(lambda x: x > 1, [1, 2, 3])  # Output: [2, 3]\n","11. Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using    \n","    reduce function on this given list:[47,11,42,13];\n"," - Mechanism: The reduce() function starts by taking the first two elements of the list, applies the function, and then replaces them with the result.\n","It continues by applying the function to the result and the next element in the list until one value remains.\n"," Example:\n","  from functools import reduce\n","  nums = [47, 11, 42, 13]\n","  result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)\n","  print(result)  # Output: 113\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hSR28OYGhUiY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
